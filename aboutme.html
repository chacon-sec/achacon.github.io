    <p>
        A little over two years ago during the summer after my first year of college I stumbled upon 
        <a href="https://cysec.team/" target="_blank" class="underline-link">CPP Cyber</a>
        and <a href="https://www.calpolyswift.org/" target="_blank" class="underline-link">Cal Poly Swift</a>. 
        Ever since then I have dedicated most of my free time doing something cybersecurity related.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am currently working at MITRE doing Cyber Threat Intel and some Adversary Emulation things but while I'm school I enjoy doing anything cybersecurity related such as competing in competitions such as CCDC and CyberForce. The certifications that I currently possess are <a href="https://eu.badgr.com/backpack/badges/66737f6ec31e9e799748f272" target="_blank" class="underline-link">Red Team Operator</a> and Security+, but I am prepping for OSCP+. Below are some of my experiences and the competitions I have participated in.
